# PingZilla Marketing Plan

> Strategy for growing PingZilla's user base and App Store presence

## Target Audiences

### Primary: Remote Workers & Digital Nomads

- **Key feature**: VPN drop detection with country change alerts
- **Where they hang out**: r/digitalnomad, r/remotework, Nomad List, Twitter

### Secondary: Gamers & Streamers
- **Pain point**: Latency spikes ruining competitive gameplay or streams
- **Key feature**: Real-time latency monitoring with visual indicators
- **Where they hang out**: r/gaming, r/Twitch, Discord servers, YouTube

### Tertiary: Developers & Power Users
- **Pain point**: Need lightweight, native tools (not Electron bloat)
- **Key feature**: Rust/Tauri stack, minimal resource usage, open source
- **Where they hang out**: Hacker News, r/macapps, r/rust, Twitter/X tech community

## Competitive Positioning

**vs. iStatMenus**: We're focused and lightweight, they're a Swiss Army knife
**vs. Ping Menu Bar**: We have VPN detection and site monitoring
**vs. Network Radar**: We're native (Tauri/Rust), not Electron

**Our unique angles:**
1. VPN drop detection (no competitor has this)
2. Expressive mood icons (fun + functional)
3. Built with Tauri 2/Rust (appeals to devs)
4. Battery optimized (important for laptop users)
